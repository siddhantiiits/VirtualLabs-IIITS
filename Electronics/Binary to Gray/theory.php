<b>BINARY CODE:</b><br><br>
It is straight binary code. The binary number system (with base 2) represents values using two symbols, typically 0 and 1.Computers call these bits as either off (0) or on (1). The binary code are made up of only zeros and ones, and used in computers to stand for letters and digits. It is used to represent numbers using natural or straight binary form. <br><br>
 
It is a weighted code since a weight is assigned to every position. Various arithmetic operations can be performed in this form. Binary code is weighted and sequential code. <br><br><br>
 <b>GRAY CODE:</b><br><br>

 
It is a modified binary code in which a decimal number is represented in binary form in such a way that each Gray- Code number differs from the preceding and the succeeding number by a single bit. (E.g. for decimal number 5 the equivalent Gray code is 0111 and for 6 it is 0101. These two codes differ by only one bit position i. e. third from the left.) Whereas by using binary code there is a possibility of change of all bits if we move from one number to other in sequence (e.g. binary code for 7 is 0111 and for 8 it is 1000). Therefore it is more useful to use Gray code in some applications than binary code. 
 <br><br>
The Gray code is a nonweighted code i.e. there are no specific weights assigned to the bit positions. 
 
Like binary numbers, the Gray code can have any no. of bits. It is also known as reflected code.
